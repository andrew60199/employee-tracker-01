# Employee Tracker

## Description

This application is a Content Management System CMS developed by developers to make the lives of none developers easier. Company team members will be able to view departments, roles and employees within their company. They will also be able to add new departments, roles and employees as their business changes. While also updating employees if they need.

Future improvements can increase the applications functionality with the ability to update an employees managers, view employees by manager or department and finally the ability to delete departments, roles and managers. 

Additionally error handling needs to be explored to prompt the user when something does go wrong. For example if they enter in a letters instead of numbers in the salary question.
